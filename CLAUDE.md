## What This Project Is

A **React Native / Expo mobile app** for UCI (University of California, Irvine) students to:
- Browse real courses offered each quarter using live UCI data
- Build a personal timetable per quarter (e.g. Spring 2026, Fall 2026)
- View a weekly schedule grid with their added courses
- Track grades per course

The app is built for iOS/Android but can also run in a web browser via Expo.

---

## How to Run

```bash
cd /Users/kmkwack/UCI-Schedule
npm install          # if node_modules is missing or outdated
npx expo start       # starts the dev server
```

- Press `w` to open in browser
- Press `i` for iOS Simulator (requires Xcode)
- Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** app on your phone (note: Expo SDK 55 may require the latest Expo Go version)

**Node.js** is required. Install via nvm:
```bash
nvm install 24
nvm use 24
```

## API: Anteater API

**Base URL:** `https://anteaterapi.com`

This is the official UCI student-built API maintained by ICSSC (ICS Student Council). No authentication required. It replaced PeterPortal API (shut down January 2025).

### Endpoints Used

#### 1. WebSoc — courses + sections for a department/quarter (primary endpoint)
```
GET https://anteaterapi.com/v2/rest/websoc?department=ECON&year=2026&quarter=Spring
```
Returns all courses and their sections in one call. This is the same endpoint AntAlmanac uses.

Response shape:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "schools": [{
      "departments": [{
        "deptCode": "ECON",
        "courses": [{
          "courseNumber": "100A",
          "courseTitle": "INTERMED MICROECON",
          "sections": [{
            "sectionCode": "36120",
            "sectionType": "Lec",
            "sectionNum": "A",
            "units": "4",
            "instructors": ["SMITH, JOHN"],
            "isCancelled": false,
            "meetings": [{
              "timeIsTBA": false,
              "days": "MWF",
              "bldg": ["SSPA 2112"],
              "startTime": { "hour": 10, "minute": 0 },
              "endTime": { "hour": 10, "minute": 50 }
            }]
          }]
        }]
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Note: `startTime`/`endTime` use 24-hour `{ hour, minute }` objects.

#### 2. Departments (not currently used, kept for reference)
```
GET https://anteaterapi.com/v2/rest/websoc/departments?since=2014
```

## Data Model

### `Course` type (`src/data/courses.ts`)
```typescript
type Course = {
  id: string;         // sectionCode from API (e.g. "36120")
  code: string;       // "ECON 100A"
  title: string;      // "Intermediate Microeconomics"
  professor: string;  // from instructors[0]
  days: string;       // "MWF", "TuTh", "Sa", etc.
  time: string;       // normalized 24hr: "10:00 - 10:50"
  department: string; // "ECON"
  addedCount: number; // always 0 (not from API)
  rating: number;     // always 0 (not from API)
  location?: string;  // from meetings[0].bldg[0]
  units?: number;
};
```

A `Course` in this app represents a **section** (a specific scheduled offering), not just a course title.

### `Quarter` type
```typescript
type Quarter = { year: string; quarter: string };
// e.g. { year: '2026', quarter: 'Spring' }
```

### Global State (`App.tsx`)
```typescript
selectedQuarter: Quarter                    // currently viewed quarter
timetables: Record<string, Course[]>        // courses per quarter, keyed by "2026-Spring"
```

Active courses = `timetables[quarterKey(selectedQuarter)] ?? []`

---

## Key Logic

### Time Normalization (`CoursePickerScreen.tsx`)
API returns time in various formats. All are normalized to `"HH:MM - HH:MM"` (24hr):
- `"8:00-8:50am"` → `"08:00 - 08:50"`
- `"2:00-3:20pm"` → `"14:00 - 15:20"`
- `"11:00am-12:20pm"` → `"11:00 - 12:20"`

### Course Number Sorting
Courses are sorted by numeric part first, then letter suffix:
- `parseInt("10C") = 10`, `parseInt("100B") = 100` → 10 comes first
- Same number → sort suffix: `100A` before `100B`

### Department Colors (`src/data/courses.ts`)
`colorForDepartment(dept)` — hashes the department string to consistently pick from a 10-color palette. Ensures the same department always gets the same color.

### Days Parsing
`getDaysArray("MWF")` → `["M", "W", "F"]`
Handles: `M`, `T`, `W`, `Th`, `F`, `Sa`, `Su`

### Conflict Detection (`CoursePickerScreen.tsx`)
When adding a section, checks if it overlaps with any already-added section on the same day. Prompts user to confirm replacement if there's a conflict.

---

## Department List

All 140+ UCI departments are hardcoded in `src/data/courses.ts` as `UCI_DEPARTMENTS`. The list was sourced from the UCI WebSoc department dropdown at `https://www.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc`.

Notable departments that were added after initial setup (were missing from original list):
`EECS`, `COGS`, `DATA`, `CBE`, `ENGRCEE`, `ENGRMAE`, `ENGRMSE`, `ASIANAM`, `BIO SCI`, and many others.

---

## Course Picker Flow

1. User opens Course Picker (taps "+ Add Class" in Timetable)
2. Selects a department from a **bottom-sheet dropdown modal** (searchable)
3. App fetches course catalog from Anteater API
4. App **immediately pre-fetches sections for every course in parallel** for the selected quarter
5. Only courses with at least one section are shown
6. Courses are sorted by course number (numeric sort, not alphabetic)
7. User taps a course → expands to show available sections
8. User taps a section → previews it in the mini timetable at the top
9. User taps "Add" → section is added to the active quarter's timetable

---

## Quarters Available

```typescript
const QUARTERS = [
  { year: '2024', quarter: 'Fall' },
  { year: '2025', quarter: 'Winter' },
  { year: '2025', quarter: 'Spring' },
  { year: '2025', quarter: 'Fall' },
  { year: '2026', quarter: 'Winter' },
  { year: '2026', quarter: 'Spring' },
  { year: '2026', quarter: 'Fall' },
];
```

The quarter picker is a horizontal scroll at the top of the Timetable screen.

---

## What Is NOT Implemented Yet

- Persistent storage (courses reset on app reload — no AsyncStorage)
- User authentication
- Push notifications / reminders
- Real GPA data (GPA is hardcoded at 3.72, credits at 64)
- Professor ratings (always 0, no RateMyProfessor integration)
- `addedCount` (always 0, no backend tracking)
- The "Wizard" and "Add manually" buttons in course picker (not wired up)
- `CoursesScreen.tsx` exists in `src/screens/` but is unused

---

## Changelog

### Session 1
- **`src/data/courses.ts`** — Created. Replaced static fake course data with proper types: `Course` (id is now `string` sectionCode), `Quarter`, `QUARTERS`, `UCI_DEPARTMENTS` (140+ departments from WebSoc), `colorForDepartment()`, `quarterKey()`, `quarterLabel()`.
- **`App.tsx`** — Replaced `addedCourses: number[]` with `timetables: Record<string, Course[]>` + `selectedQuarter: Quarter`. Each quarter has its own independent course list. `handleToggleCourse` now takes full `Course` object.
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Added horizontal quarter picker scroll at the top. Now receives `activeCourses: Course[]` directly instead of resolving IDs against static data. Uses `colorForDepartment()` for timetable block colors.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Full rewrite. Replaced static course list with live Anteater API integration. Two-step flow: department dropdown → catalog fetch → per-course section fetch. Added time normalization (`normalizeApiTime`), section-to-Course mapping, conflict detection, department bottom-sheet modal with search, course number sorting, pre-fetching + filtering of courses with no sections.
- **`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`** — Removed static `courses` import. Now receives `activeCourses: Course[]` directly.
- **`src/screens/GradesScreen.tsx`** — Removed static `courses` import. Now receives `activeCourses: Course[]`. Grade state key changed from `number` to `string`.
- **`src/components/PreviewTimetable.tsx`** — Updated `colorForCourse` to use `colorForDepartment()` from `courses.ts`.
- **`UCI_DEPARTMENTS`** — Expanded from ~60 to 140+ departments matching WebSoc exactly. Added EECS, COGS, DATA, CBE, ENGRCEE, ENGRMAE, and many others.
- **Course sorting** — `filteredCatalog` in `CoursePickerScreen` now sorts by numeric course number first (so `10C` appears before `100B`), then by letter suffix.
- **Department selector** — Replaced horizontal chip scroll with a searchable bottom-sheet modal dropdown.

### Session 2
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Sections within an expanded course are now sorted by `sectionNum` (e.g. A1 before A2) using `localeCompare` with `numeric: true`, so discussion/lab sections display in the correct ascending order.

### Session 3
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Fixed missing courses (especially numbered 1–99 and 200+). Root cause: firing 100+ parallel `enrollmentHistory` requests at once overwhelmed the API, causing many to fail silently and those courses to be incorrectly filtered out. Fix: replaced `Promise.all` over all courses with a batched loop (`BATCH_SIZE = 6`), processing 6 courses at a time so the API is not overwhelmed.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Switched from `enrollmentHistory` (N batched calls) to `GET /v2/rest/websoc?department=X&year=Y&quarter=Z` (single call). This is the same endpoint AntAlmanac uses. Returns all courses and sections in one hierarchical response (schools → departments → courses → sections). Removed `enrollmentHistory` batching entirely. Updated types: `ApiCourse`/`ApiSection` → `CatalogCourse`/`WebsocSection`/`WebsocCourse`. Updated time formatting: `normalizeApiTime()` → `formatWebsocTime()` (uses `{ hour, minute }` objects from the websoc response, already 24hr). `sectionsMap` now stores pre-mapped `Course[]` instead of raw section objects. Cancelled sections (`isCancelled: true`) are filtered out automatically.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Fixed duplicate key error (e.g. `EECS195`, `EECS298`). Root cause: the websoc response can list the same course under multiple schools in its hierarchy. Fix: replaced `newCatalog[]` array with a `catalogMap` keyed by `courseId`. On duplicate, sections are merged (deduped by `sectionCode`) instead of creating a second catalog entry.

### Session 4
- **`src/data/courses.ts`** — Removed past quarters (Fall 2024, Winter 2025, Spring 2025) from `QUARTERS`. Remaining quarters start from Fall 2025.
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Replaced horizontal quarter-chip scroll with a compact top-right dropdown button showing the current quarter. Tapping it opens a Modal overlay with all quarters listed; active quarter is highlighted with a checkmark. "Add Class" button moved inline next to the quarter picker. Timetable grid now shows immediately below without the chip row taking vertical space.

### Session 5
- **`src/screens/FriendsScreen.tsx`** — Created. New Friends tab with two views: (1) friends list showing name, course count, and a delete button; (2) friend timetable view with the same weekly grid as TimetableScreen plus a quarter dropdown and "Add" button that opens CoursePickerScreen for that friend. "Add Friend" opens a modal with a name input. All state is in-memory (no persistence yet).
- **`App.tsx`** — Added `'friends'` to the tab type, imported `FriendsScreen`, rendered it at `currentTab === 'friends'`, and added a "Friends" tab item with `people-outline` icon.

### Session 6
- **`src/data/courses.ts`** — Added optional `sectionLabel?: string` field to the `Course` type to carry human-readable section info (e.g. "Lec A", "Dis A1").
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — `mapWebsocSection` now populates `sectionLabel` as `"${sectionType} ${sectionNum}"` from the API response. Section rows in the picker now display `sectionLabel` (e.g. "Lec A", "Dis A1") instead of the raw section code number.

### Session 7
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Added `sortSections()` to sort raw `WebsocSection[]` before mapping: first by type (Lec → Dis → Lab → other), then by letter prefix of `sectionNum` (A, B, C…), then by numeric suffix (1, 2, 3…). Applied before `mapWebsocSection` in the websoc response handler.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Section row title now shows `"12345 · Lec A"` (code + label). Row order changed to: code/label → professor → units → building → days/time. Units formatted as `"1 unit"` / `"4 units"`.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Added `formatLocation()`: maps `"VRTL REMOTE"` and `"ON LINE"` building strings to `"Online"` in the section display.

### Session 8
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Extended `filteredCatalog` search to also match full course codes (e.g. `"ECON 100A"`) and professor names (checks all sections in `sectionsMap` for a professor match). Added `sectionsMap` to the `useMemo` dependency array. Updated search placeholder text.

### Session 9
- **`App.tsx`** — Added `focusedCourseId` state and threaded it between the course picker and timetable so the app can remember which class should be centered in the timetable after user interaction.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — When a section is added, the picker now marks that course as the next timetable focus target. Removing a section clears the pending focus target.
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Made timetable blocks tappable and added automatic scroll-to-center behavior for the selected/newly added course by wiring horizontal and vertical scroll positioning to the focused course id.

### Session 10
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — After a successful `Add` action, the course picker now closes immediately so the user returns to the timetable and can see the automatic scroll-to-focused-course behavior. The same applies after confirming a conflict replacement.

### Session 11
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Changed the `Add` flow so the course picker stays open. After adding a section, the top preview timetable now keeps that section as the active preview target, so the visible timetable in the picker scrolls to the added class instead of closing the screen.

### Session 12
- **`src/components/PreviewTimetable.tsx`** — Aligned the preview timetable’s grid sizing with `TimetableScreen` so weekday columns use the same width calculation and Friday no longer gets clipped. Removed the preview-only minimum day width that was forcing unnecessary horizontal overflow.
- **`src/components/PreviewTimetable.tsx`** — Excluded `TBA` courses from preview grid math and changed rendered course labels to use `course.code`, making the course-picker preview look closer to the main timetable instead of shifting to a different visual structure.

### Session 13
- **`App.tsx`** — Changed the course picker from a hard content swap to an animated overlay. It now slides up from the bottom on open and slides back down on close using `Animated` + `translateY`.
- **`src/components/PreviewTimetable.tsx`** — Added optional background tap handling on the timetable grid so tapping empty space in the preview can dismiss the course picker without interfering with course blocks.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Wired the preview timetable’s empty-space tap to `onClose`, so users can close the picker by tapping a blank area in the timetable preview.

### Session 14
- **`App.tsx`** — Reworked the main timetable’s course picker into a half-height bottom sheet instead of a full-screen overlay. The real timetable now stays visible behind it while the picker slides up from the bottom.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Added `sheetMode` so the picker can render as a compact bottom sheet with just the search/department/course list area, while still keeping the full-screen version for other flows.
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Added optional empty-grid tap handling on the real timetable, allowing users to dismiss the half sheet by tapping a blank part of the visible timetable behind it.

### Session 15
- **`App.tsx`** — Fixed the bottom-sheet overlay container to span the full screen with explicit `top: 0` and overlay stacking, so the half-sheet picker actually appears above the timetable when `+ Add` is tapped.

### Session 16
- **`App.tsx`** — Added explicit close interactions for the main timetable bottom sheet: tapping the visible timetable area above the sheet now dismisses it, and dragging the sheet handle downward closes it once the gesture passes a threshold.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Added support for sheet handle pan handlers so the compact picker can participate in drag-to-close gestures without changing its full-screen mode behavior.

### Session 17
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Reduced the day-header row’s left spacer and slightly lowered the hour-label offset so the first time label (`08:00`) is no longer clipped at the top while keeping the weekday tabs aligned with the timetable grid.

### Session 18
- **`App.tsx`** — Reverted the main timetable picker from the experimental half-sheet back to the full-screen animated overlay, restoring the previous interaction model where the course picker has its own dedicated preview timetable.
- **`src/screens/CoursePickerScreen.tsx`** — Removed the temporary sheet-only mode and restored the original full-screen picker layout with the built-in preview timetable at the top.
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Removed the temporary empty-grid dismissal hook that was only needed for the half-sheet experiment.

### Session 19
- **`App.tsx`** — Removed a stale `pickerSheetHeight` reference from the picker animation effect dependencies after reverting the half-sheet experiment. This fixes the runtime error complaining that `pickerSheetHeight` does not exist.

### Session 20
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Removed the trailing rightmost vertical grid line by skipping the right border on the last day column, matching the left side of the timetable.
- **`src/components/PreviewTimetable.tsx`** — Applied the same last-column border rule to the course-picker preview timetable so its grid matches the main timetable.

### Session 21
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Removed the time text from course blocks so the timetable cards now show only the course code and professor.
- **`src/screens/FriendsScreen.tsx`** — Applied the same course-block text simplification to the friend timetable view for consistency with the main timetable.

### Session 22
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Increased the timetable grid height slightly so each hour row has a bit more vertical space.
- **`src/screens/FriendsScreen.tsx`** — Matched the main timetable’s slightly taller hour spacing in the friend timetable view.
- **`src/components/PreviewTimetable.tsx`** — Increased preview hour height slightly so the course-picker mini timetable stays visually aligned with the more spacious main timetable.

### Session 23
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Changed course-code rendering so the department stays on the first line and the numeric course identifier moves to the second line inside timetable blocks.
- **`src/screens/FriendsScreen.tsx`** — Applied the same two-line course-code formatting to friend timetable blocks.
- **`src/components/PreviewTimetable.tsx`** — Matched the preview timetable’s course-code formatting so preview cards also render the numeric portion on the second line.

### Session 24
- **`src/lib/supabase.ts`** — Created. Supabase client configured with project URL and publishable key. Uses AsyncStorage for session persistence.
- **`src/data/courses.ts`** — Added `Timetable` type (`id`, `name`, `quarterKey`, `courses[]`) to support multiple named timetables per quarter.
- **`App.tsx`** — Replaced `timetables: Record<string, Course[]>` with `timetables: Timetable[]` + `selectedTimetableId`. Added Supabase load on mount (`guest` user), `saveTimetable()` upsert, `createTimetable()` insert. `handleToggleCourse` now auto-creates a timetable if none exists for the quarter. Quarter change auto-selects the first timetable for the new quarter. New props passed to TimetableScreen: `quarterTimetables`, `activeTimetableId`, `onSelectTimetable`, `onCreateTimetable`.
- **`src/screens/TimetableScreen.tsx`** — Added timetable switcher row below the header: named pill tabs for each timetable in the current quarter, plus a `+ New` button to create additional ones.

### Session 25
- **`src/screens/FriendsScreen.tsx`** — Redesigned friends list to match Figma: white background, search bar, Friends/Requests tab switcher, new friend row layout (blue circle avatar with 2-letter initials, name + major•year subtitle, Timetable pill button, send circle button, separator lines). Added `major` and `year` fields to `Friend` type. Add friend modal now includes major and year inputs. `getInitials()` helper extracts first+last initials from name.
- **`App.tsx`** — Added `'board'` tab between Grades and Friends. Updated tab icons: Grades uses `school-outline`, Board uses `clipboard-outline`, Friends uses `person-add-outline`.
- **`src/screens/BoardScreen.tsx`** — Created. Community board with search bar, category filter chips (All/Sports/Study Groups/Marketplace/Club Promotions), Recent/Popular sort toggle, and mock post cards. Each post shows avatar with initials, name/role/time, category tag, title, body, and tappable like/comment counts.

### Session 26
### Session 27
- **`src/screens/WelcomeScreen.tsx`** — Created. Landing screen with blue calendar app icon + purple book badge, "Welcome to UniTrack" title, Sign In and Create Account buttons, guest shortcut buttons (guest/guest2/guest3/guest4), and Terms footer.
- **`src/screens/SignInScreen.tsx`** — Created. Sign in form with email + password inputs (with icons), password visibility toggle, remember me checkbox, Forgot password link, Sign In button, OR divider, Continue with Google button, and Sign up link. Sign-in is a placeholder (no real Supabase auth yet).
- **`App.tsx`** — Added `userId` and `authScreen` state. App shows WelcomeScreen or SignInScreen when not logged in. Guest buttons set `userId` directly and skip auth. `USER_ID` is now derived from state instead of hardcoded. Timetable load now only triggers when `userId` is set.

- **`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`** — Full redesign to match Figma.

### Session 28
- **`src/screens/GradesScreen.tsx`** — Full redesign. Stats row (GPA/Credits/Courses). Animated GPA trend chart: line draws left-to-right on mount using a ClipPath whose width is driven by an `Animated.Value` listener updating React state. Smooth bezier curve via cubic control points. Current quarter courses show grade badge (tap to pick) or "Select Grade" button; grade picker is a bottom-sheet modal. Past Semesters section with collapsible semester cards (LayoutAnimation expand/collapse). GPA is computed from all graded courses weighted by credits. New sections: (1) Header with date + week number (computed from Spring 2026 quarter start Mar 30); (2) "Your Day" card with class count, rotating quote, and "Coming Up" next class with left accent bar; (3) Weather card with indigo tinted background, large temp, cloud icon; (4) Campus Events card with icon badges, event title/time/location, separator lines. Removed old briefing text, stat grid, and quick action buttons.
